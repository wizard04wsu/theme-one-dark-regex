# One Dark for Regex
This is an enhancement of Atom's [One Dark syntax theme](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/one-dark-syntax), adding regular expression syntax highlighting.

Made, in particular, for use with the [javascript-regex](https://github.com/wizard04wsu/javascript-regex) package.
